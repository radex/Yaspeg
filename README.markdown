YASPEG
======
(Yet Another Stupid Platform Game)
----------------------------------

**Yaspeg** is (as the name indicates) another stupid and pointless project that has been written only *for learning purposes* (in this case: Cocoa, Core Animations and other mac frameworks). It absolutely makes no sense and in fact *it's not even platform game* - there's no platforms. In fact, it's even hard to call it a game. But it's fun to write, and learn. You can download code, learn, make some new code and send me commit request - but I really doubt anyone will ever want to do that.

Note: comments in code sucks, because my English sucks. Sorry ;) It's also good thing to learn, and I promise - I will work on it.

PS. And why the fuck I'm writing README - probably noone will ever read it!
